    "story": "Legend / Pūrākau: In Ngāi Tahu tradition, Aoraki was the eldest son of Raki (Ranginui, the Sky Father). Along with his three brothers, he travelled in a canoe that capsized on a reef. They climbed on top, but the cold winds froze them into stone. Aoraki became the tallest peak, and his brothers the surrounding mountains, while the overturned canoe became Kā Tiritiri o te Moana (Southern Alps). Historically, Aoraki is central to Ngāi Tahu identity and remains tapu, representing their ancestral connection to the South Island landscape.",

When the canoe was wrecked, its gourds and kumara spilled ashore and turned to stone. The canoe itself became a reef, while the commander became nearby rock formations. Historically, the site is both a geological wonder—giant concretions millions of years old—and a taonga (treasure) embodying ancestral memory and voyaging heritage.",

    "story": "Legend / Pūrākau: According to Māori tradition (especially Taranaki iwi and related hapū), Mount Taranaki was once in the central North Island, in the company of mountains Ruapehu, Tongariro, and Ngauruhoe. The story goes that Taranaki fell in love with the beautiful mountain Pihanga. When Ruapehu also courted Pihanga, quarrel ensued. Taranaki, defeated in that contest, travelled westwards, carving the path of the Whanganui River with his tears, finally settled where he is now on the west coast of the North Island. Meanwhile, Tongariro stayed closer to Pihanga in rivalry, etc. This journey explains the geographic separation of those volcanoes and shape of land.",
